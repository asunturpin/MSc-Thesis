## Abstract
This Master's thesis focuses on developing a computational method to facilitate the retrieval of orthologous genes across species. Orthologous genes, which are crucial for comparative genomics and biomedical research, are dispersed across various heterogeneous databases, making interoperability a challenge. This project aligns with the efforts of the Quest for Orthologs consortium, which aims to standardize orthologous information using the ORTH ontology. The method integrates data from two significant orthology databases, InParanoid and OMA, using SPARQL queries on RDF repositories. By automating the query process and introducing a reliability scoring system based on data curation status and presence across databases, this method enhances the accessibility and usability of orthologous data for researchers. The results demonstrate the method's efficacy in combining information from InParanoid and OMA, providing a reliable and user-friendly tool for retrieving orthologous genes. Future work will focus on addressing technical challenges with GraphDB to fully integrate additional databases like TreeFam and further refine the reliability scoring system.

## Tools
* Use of standarized semantic web information such as ORTH ontology.
* Manage GraphDB as a repository to upload InParanoid database in RDF format.
* Use SPARQL language to make queries from OMA enpoint and InParanoid GraphDB repository.
* Employ platforms such as Jupyter Notebook to write Python code in order to develop the final method.
